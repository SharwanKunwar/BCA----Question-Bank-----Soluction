# Sequential Circuits

Sequential circuits are a type of digital circuit that, unlike combinational circuits, utilize past state information to determine their next state.  While combinational circuits rely solely on current input values to produce outputs, sequential circuits depend on both current inputs *and* previous outputs. This is achieved through the use of memory elements, which store the previous state.

## What are Sequential Circuits?

Sequential circuits are fundamental building blocks in digital systems. They are used to implement a wide range of functionalities, including:

* **State Machines:**  These are systems that transition between different states based on input and current state.
* **Timers:** Circuits that generate precise time intervals.
* **Counters:** Circuits that increment or decrement a stored value.
* **Memory Elements:**  The core components for storing data.

Sequential circuits are essential components in digital system design.

## Memory Elements

The key difference between sequential and combinational circuits lies in the presence of memory elements.  These elements allow the circuit to "remember" its previous state.  A common implementation of memory elements uses flip-flops.  Flip-flops are circuits capable of storing binary values (0 or 1) and maintaining that state even after the input changes.  This ability to hold a value is crucial for sequential circuit operation.
