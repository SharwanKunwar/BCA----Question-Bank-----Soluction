## ðŸ“˜ Sequential Circuits

### Definition:
Sequential circuits are a type of digital circuit where the present output depends not only on the current input but also on the past outputs. These circuits use memory elements, like **flip-flops**, to store previous states and manage the sequence of operations.

### Key Features:
- **Memory Elements**: Sequential circuits use memory (like **flip-flops**) to store previous states.
- **Dependence on Past Outputs**: The output is influenced by both the current input and previous outputs.
- **Types of Sequential Circuits**: Examples include **Synchronous Circuits** (timed by a clock) and **Asynchronous Circuits** (no clock).

### Example:
For instance, a **flip-flop** in a sequential circuit can store a bit of data (either 0 or 1) and use that data in future operations.
