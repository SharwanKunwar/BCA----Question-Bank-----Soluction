# Digital and Analog Signals, K-Map, and Priority Encoder

## Analog Signal
**Definition:**  
An analog signal is a continuous signal that varies over time and can take any value within a given range. It represents real-world phenomena such as sound, temperature, and voltage.

**Example:**  
A human voice transmitted through a telephone line is an analog signal because it continuously varies in amplitude and frequency.

## Digital Signal
**Definition:**  
A digital signal is a discrete signal that represents data in binary form (0s and 1s). Unlike analog signals, digital signals have distinct levels and do not vary continuously.

**Example:**  
Audio stored in a computer as an MP3 file is a digital signal because it consists of binary data that can be processed and transmitted without degradation.

## Karnaugh Map (K-Map)
**Definition:**  
A Karnaugh Map (K-map) is a graphical tool used to simplify Boolean algebra expressions by organizing truth table values into a grid format. It helps in minimizing logical expressions, reducing the number of logic gates required in digital circuits.
