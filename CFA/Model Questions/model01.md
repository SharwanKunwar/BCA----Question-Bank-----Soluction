### 2. What do you mean by computer architecture? Describe the functional components of computer architecture with a block diagram.  

Computer architecture refers to the design and organization of a computer system, including its hardware components, how they interact, and how they execute instructions. It defines the structure, functionality, and performance of a computer, covering aspects like the processor, memory, input/output (I/O) devices, and data transfer mechanisms.  

## Functional Components of Computer Architecture

A computer system consists of several functional components that work together to execute tasks. The main components are:  

### i. Input Unit  
- Accepts data and instructions from external sources (e.g., keyboard, mouse).  
- Converts the input into a format the computer can process.  

### ii. Central Processing Unit (CPU)  
The **CPU** is the brain of the computer, responsible for processing and executing instructions. It comprises three main subunits:  
- **Control Unit (CU)**: Directs the flow of data and manages instruction execution.  
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: Performs mathematical and logical operations.  
- **Registers**: Small, high-speed storage locations inside the CPU for temporary data storage.  

### iii. Memory Unit  
Stores data and instructions temporarily or permanently. There are two types:  
- **Primary Memory (RAM, ROM)**: Used for temporary storage while executing programs.  
- **Secondary Memory (HDD, SSD)**: Stores data permanently.  

### iv. Output Unit  
- Converts processed data into a human-readable format.  
- Examples: Monitor, printer, speaker.  

### v. Bus System  
The **bus system** transfers data between different components of the computer. It consists of:  
- **Data Bus**: Transfers actual data.  
- **Address Bus**: Carries the address of the data.  
- **Control Bus**: Transfers control signals for synchronization.

### 3. Define operating system. Explain the type of operating system with their examples.
An operating system (OS) is a curical piece of software that manages the computer's hardware and software resources and provide common services to coputer program. It act as an intermediary between user and computer hardware, ensuring that application can function efficently and effectively.

# Types of Operating Systems  

## i. Network Operating System (NOS)  
- Manages network resources, allowing multiple devices to communicate and share files.  
- Ensures network security, remote access, and centralized management.  
- **Example:** Windows Server, Novell NetWare  

## ii. Mobile Operating System  
- Developed specifically for smartphones, tablets, and wearable devices.  
- Provides an interface optimized for touch and mobile applications.  
- **Example:** Android, iOS, HarmonyOS  

## iii. Embedded Operating System  
- A lightweight OS used in dedicated hardware systems.  
- Designed for specific tasks, like controlling home appliances, medical devices, and automotive systems.  
- **Example:** FreeRTOS, Windows Embedded, VxWorks  

## iv. Batch Operating System  
- In a Batch OS, similar jobs are grouped together and executed without user interaction.  
- The OS processes jobs in batches, reducing manual intervention.  
- **Example:** IBM OS/360, Windows Batch Processing
