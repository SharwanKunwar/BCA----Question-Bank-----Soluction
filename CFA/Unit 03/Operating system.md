## Unit 02 Operating Systems (OS)

### Definition:
An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that acts as an interface between computer hardware and the user. It manages hardware resources, runs applications, and provides an environment for users to interact with the computer.

### Key Functions of an Operating System:

#### 1. Process Management
- The OS handles multiple running processes and allocates CPU time efficiently.
- Ensures smooth execution of multiple tasks simultaneously (**multitasking**).

#### 2. Memory Management
- The OS allocates memory to running programs and prevents conflicts.
- Ensures efficient use of RAM to avoid system crashes or slowdowns.

#### 3. File System Management
- Organizes and stores files, allowing users to access data efficiently.
- Maintains directories, permissions, and security settings.

#### 4. Device Management
- Controls and communicates with input/output devices (printers, keyboards, monitors).
- Uses **drivers** to ensure hardware compatibility.

#### 5. Security & Protection
- Protects data using authentication methods (**passwords, biometrics, encryption**).
- Prevents unauthorized access and malware attacks.

#### 6. User Interface (UI)
- Provides a way for users to interact with the system through **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** or **Command Line Interface (CLI).**

### Types of Operating Systems:

#### 1. Single-User OS
- Designed for one user at a time.
- **Examples:** Windows 10, macOS.

#### 2. Multi-User OS
- Allows multiple users to access the system simultaneously.
- **Examples:** UNIX, Linux.

#### 3. Real-Time OS (RTOS)
- Processes tasks in real-time with minimal delay.
- Used in robotics, medical devices, and industrial automation.
- **Examples:** QNX, VxWorks.

#### 4. Embedded OS
- Used in specialized devices like **ATMs, smart TVs, and IoT devices.**
- **Examples:** Android Wear (for smartwatches), iOS (for iPhones).

#### 5. Network OS
- Manages computers and resources in a **networked environment.**
- **Examples:** Windows Server, Linux Server.

#### 6. Mobile OS
- Designed for **smartphones and tablets.**
- **Examples:** Android, iOS.

### Popular Operating Systems and Their Uses:
- **Windows** – Developed by Microsoft, used for personal and business computing.
- **MacOS** – Apple’s OS, known for stability and security.
- **Linux** – Open-source OS with high security and flexibility.
- **Android** – Google’s OS for smartphones and tablets.
- **iOS** – Apple’s mobile OS for iPhones and iPads.

### Advantages of an Operating System:
✔ **User-Friendly** – Provides a convenient interface for users.
✔ **Efficient Resource Management** – Optimizes CPU, memory, and storage.
✔ **Security Features** – Protects data from malware and unauthorized access.
✔ **Multitasking Capabilities** – Runs multiple applications at the same time.
✔ **Hardware Support** – Manages input/output devices effectively.

### Disadvantages of an Operating System:
❌ **System Crashes** – Bugs or hardware failures can cause crashes.
❌ **Security Risks** – Vulnerable to hacking and malware.
❌ **Software Compatibility Issues** – Some applications may not run on all operating systems.
❌ **High Cost** – Paid operating systems like Windows and macOS require licenses.
